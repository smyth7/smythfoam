# Biology

I currently mainly work on biological applications of machine learning, but I remain a bio-beginner. Many references here may be too introductory for your tastes. 

## The classical canon

**A very biased personal take based on MITx 7.00x:**

A great review of biology basics by Eric Lander: [MITx 7.00x Introduction to Biology - The Secret of Life](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-biology-the-secret-of-life-3)

and its textbooks: 

Searchable version of Alberts et al [Molecular Biology of the Cell, 4th edition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/)

Searchable version of Griffiths et al [An Introduction to Genetic Analysis, 7th edition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21766/)

## MOOCs, books and other tutorials

[Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/), Susan Holmes Wolfgang Huber, free book. 

Introduction to Protein Structure 2nd Edition by Carl Branden (Author), John Tooze (Author)
