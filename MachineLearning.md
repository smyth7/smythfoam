# Machine Learning

Based on the list first drawn up for my talk "Straight outta Swampland" at the ITF KU Leuven in January 2020. If you get the joke and are interested, then feel free to poke me for the slides.

Specific topics are covered in their own pages [[NLP]], [[ComputerVision]], [[TimeSeries]] and [[AGI]]
