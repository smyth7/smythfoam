# Welcome

This may become a useless brain dump, but the initial goal is to capture useless references for AI, Machine Learning and Data Science. I'll probably also touch on DevOps and 'all the the stuff' around [[AIMLDS]], including career advice. 

My goal is to start building up [[AIMLDS]] from my Leuven slides and other references.

I will list links to useful pages and articles on note-taking and tools in [[Notes]]

ðŸ‘‹ This is built from [[foam]] and I've left the initial docs here.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[AIMLDS]: AIMLDS "AI ML DS"
[Notes]: Notes "Notes"
[foam]: foam "Foam"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
